# Choosing a signer

The signer is the security boundary. `soroauth.Signer` only asks for an address
and for a signature `ScVal`; the real difference between implementations is
where the private key lives, what trust boundary the signer crosses, and what
evidence the repository has for that path.

This repository ships several signer modes. They are all built on the same
signing API, but they do not carry the same threat model or the same level of
evidence.

## Short answer

- Use `NewEd25519Signer` for a single in-process key in tests, local tools, or a
  service that already owns the key.
- Use `NewAccountMultiSigner` for a classic Stellar account that requires
  multiple independent keys.
- Use `NewPasskeySigner` / `NewPasskeySignerFromAssertion` for a browser or
  WebAuthn-backed wallet contract whose signature shape is defined by that
  contract.
- Use `NewLedgerSigner`, `NewVaultSigner`, or the KMS adapters when the key must
  live outside the process.
- Use `remote.NewSigner` only behind authenticated, encrypted transport; the
  shipped example is intentionally a local reference, not production network
  security.
- Use `SignerFunc` only when a custom account's `__check_auth` requires a custom
  `ScVal` and you have reviewed that contract's layout.

## Evidence and the production bar

This repository does not claim that any signer is audited. The library as a
whole is still `v0.1.0` and `unaudited`. The ones with real live proof in this
repo are the ones used in the live testnet scenarios and golden vectors:

- `NewEd25519Signer`
- `NewAccountMultiSigner`
- passkey signer path
- delegated-signer path

Those paths have direct live transaction evidence in `e2e/RESULTS.md` and
corresponding golden-vector checks.

The hardware, remote, Vault, and cloud KMS signers are all well-tested in their
own ways, but they are not all proven by the same live e2e path. In particular,
do not recommend a signer for production use when the repository has no live e2e
evidence for it; the right choice is to require your own operational review and
a contract-specific verification path.

## Threat model by signer type

### 1. Single-key in-memory signing

`NewEd25519Signer` keeps the key in the process. This is the simplest model and
the easiest to reason about, but it is also the easiest to compromise if the
host is compromised or the application is misconfigured.

Use it when:

- the application already owns the signing secret;
- the process is trusted;
- the runtime is short-lived or tightly controlled.

Do not use it when:

- the secret must survive beyond the process boundary;
- you need operator approval or device-level custody;
- the key is not allowed to be extracted by a compromised host.

### 2. Multi-key classic accounts

`NewAccountMultiSigner` solves a different problem: a single compromised key
should not grant access. A classic Stellar account can require several
signatures and enforce ordering and caps exactly as the host expects.

Use it when:

- the account is a classic account with separate signing keys;
- your policy is threshold-based or separates operator roles;
- you need the host's ordering rules enforced in code.

The most important rule is that the host rejects unordered or duplicate vectors,
and this library enforces that before the entry is submitted.

### 3. Passkeys and custom account contracts

A passkey signer is not a classic-account signer. A custom account decides what
`ScVal` shape it accepts and what bytes it verifies. The passkey shape is
therefore contract-specific, not protocol-defined.

Use it when:

- the account's `__check_auth` is a wallet contract that expects a
  WebAuthn/P-256 signature shape;
- the browser or authenticator is the trusted source of the challenge and
  signature;
- you have verified the contract's exact `ScVal` layout and challenge-binding
  rules.

This repository's passkey path has evidence for the wallet signature shape and
for the challenge-binding logic, but it is still not a general-purpose approval
layer for every custom wallet contract.

### 4. Hardware signing

`NewLedgerSigner` removes the seed from the host and asks the device to review
and sign the payload. That materially reduces the risk of host compromise, but
it shifts the trust model to the device, the user, and the wallet app's review
flow.

Use it when:

- the operator is physically present or the device review is part of the control
  plane;
- you need the private key out of the application process from the start;
- your workflow accepts the extra operational steps and the device-specific
  failure modes.

### 5. Vault, KMS, and remote signers

Vault, AWS KMS, and GCP KMS all aim to keep the key material under somebody
else's custody. That is valuable, but the trust boundary changes:

- Vault requires correct policy, token rotation, and key naming.
- AWS and GCP require IAM, key versioning, and key usage policies.
- A remote signer requires authenticated transport and a clear authorization
  model.

These signers are useful when company policy requires secrets to be outside the
application runtime, but they are not magic. They still need operational reviews
and contract-specific validation before production use.

### 6. CLI exec-based external signer (`--signer-cmd`)

From the command line, `soroauth sign --signer-cmd <executable>` delegates
signing to an external program over `stdin` and `stdout` using the same JSON
message shapes as `remote/protocol.go`:

```json
{"version":1,"address":"G...","preimage":"<base64 HashIdPreimage>","payload":"<64-char hex sha256>"}
```

The helper writes `{"signature":"<base64 XDR ScVal>"}` (or `{"error":"..."}`) to
`stdout`. Because the full `HashIdPreimage` is passed alongside the 32-byte
digest, the helper can recompute the SHA-256 payload and show the operator which
contract function, arguments, nonce, and expiration ledger they are approving.
The CLI validates the returned `ScVal` before writing it into the authorization
entry, distinguishes non-zero exit, timeout (`--signer-timeout`), and malformed
output as separate errors, and strips secret-bearing variables from the helper's
environment.

## Do not use these as blanket recommendations

The following patterns are useful in local tests or in expert-controlled
deployments, but they are not safe blanket recommendations for production
without additional review:

- bare in-memory ed25519 keys in long-lived services;
- remote signers without authenticated TLS and explicit authorization;
- custom `SignerFunc` implementations whose format was never reviewed against
  the contract;
- any signer for which the repository has no live e2e proof and you cannot
  explain the operational control plane.

## Practical guidance

1. For a single app-owned account key, start with `NewEd25519Signer`.
2. For a classic account that uses multiple keys, use `NewAccountMultiSigner`.
3. For user-owned credentials, use a passkey signer bound to the wallet contract
   you actually deploy.
4. For operator-controlled custody, choose `NewLedgerSigner` or a KMS/Vault
   signer and keep the rest of the runtime minimal.
5. For service separation, use `remote.NewSigner` only behind authenticated
   transport and with a clear trust model for the remote signer.

## Status

All shipped signers are `unaudited` as part of this library's `v0.1.0` status.
That is not a recommendation to avoid them; it is a reminder that the difference
between a signer type and a safe production deployment is the operating model
around the key, not just the Go implementation.
