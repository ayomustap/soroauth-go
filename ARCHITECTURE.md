# Architecture

soroauth turns an unsigned `SorobanAuthorizationEntry` into a correctly signed
one. This document explains what that involves, how the pieces fit, and which
rules are protocol requirements rather than local choices.

If you are here to pick up an issue, read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
first for setup and the PR checklist. This file is the map.

If the vocabulary is new — credential arm, preimage, payload, nonce, delegate
ordering — [docs/glossary.md](docs/glossary.md) defines each term in a sentence
or two and cites the CAP that defines it. It is worth skimming before this file
rather than after.

Every Markdown file here is link-checked by the
[`links` workflow](.github/workflows/links.yml) and spell-checked by the
[`spellcheck` workflow](.github/workflows/spellcheck.yml). Neither gates a pull
request — pull requests carry five checks, the three in `ci.yml` plus `codeql`
and `dependency review` in [`security.yml`](.github/workflows/security.yml) — so
both run on push to `main`, on a weekly schedule, and on demand. Internal links
(between files in this repository) and spelling are failed on those runs;
external links are only reported, since a page moving elsewhere is not a
regression in this project.

## The problem

When a Soroban contract calls `require_auth()` on an address that is **not** the
transaction's source account, the transaction must carry a signed authorization
entry for that address. The entry has two halves:

```
SorobanAuthorizationEntry
├── credentials      who approves, plus nonce, expiration, and signature
└── rootInvocation   the call tree being approved
```

The signer never signs the entry. It signs `SHA-256(XDR(HashIdPreimage))`, and
**which preimage variant applies is decided by the credentials arm**:

| Credentials arm                              | Value | Preimage variant                                            | Address in signed bytes |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `SOROBAN_CREDENTIALS_SOURCE_ACCOUNT`         | 0     | none — the envelope signature covers it                     | n/a                     |
| `SOROBAN_CREDENTIALS_ADDRESS`                | 1     | `ENVELOPE_TYPE_SOROBAN_AUTHORIZATION` (9)                   | no                      |
| `SOROBAN_CREDENTIALS_ADDRESS_V2`             | 2     | `..._WITH_ADDRESS` (10)                                     | yes                     |
| `SOROBAN_CREDENTIALS_ADDRESS_WITH_DELEGATES` | 3     | `..._WITH_ADDRESS` (10), bound to the **top-level** address | yes                     |

Arms 1 is CAP-46-11. Arms 2 and 3 are CAP-71-01 and CAP-71-02.

</details>

Two properties hold throughout and are the reason most of the code exists:

1. **The expiration signed over and the expiration stored must be identical.**
   `AuthorizeEntry` sets both from its `validUntilLedger` argument. If they ever
   diverge the entry looks complete and fails on-chain after fees.
2. **Caller input is never mutated.** Every function returning a modified entry
   deep-copies first via `internal/xdrcopy`, because the go-stellar-sdk XDR
   types are trees of pointers and slices.

## Envelopes

Callers hold transaction envelopes, not loose entries, so every entry-shaped
function has an envelope-shaped counterpart that finds the entries for them:
`EnvelopeEntries` and `InspectEnvelope` (read), `AuthorizeEnvelope` (sign),
`EnvelopePayloads` (what a signer would be approving). Each `EnvelopeEntry`
carries the operation index and entry index it came from, which is what a caller
needs to line a signed entry back up with.

An envelope with no `invokeHostFunction` operation is refused with
`ErrNoInvokeOperation`, never reported as an empty result: "nothing to
authorize" and "nothing I looked for" must not read the same. A fee-bump
envelope is read through to its inner transaction, because a fee-bump
transaction has no operations of its own and it is the inner transaction's
entries the host checks (CAP-15).

Signing entries changes what the transaction costs to run, so the envelope
assembled from the record-mode simulation carries too small a resource fee and
is rejected on-chain after fees are paid. Once the entries are signed the caller
must simulate again in **enforce** mode and submit what that pass produced.
soroauth does not run that pass — it belongs to the caller's RPC client — and
nothing here pretends otherwise; `adapters/walletsdk` makes a wallet say so in
code before it can obtain a submittable envelope.

## Untrusted input

`Inspect` and the CLI are pointed at entries from elsewhere by design, so the
base64 decoder and every recursive walk over an entry are bounded on purpose.
`DecodeAuthorizationEntry` applies 64 levels of nesting and 1 MiB of decoded
input, and returns `ErrDecodeLimit` when either bites. `Inspect`,
`ValidateDelegateOrder`, the credential-node walk in `AuthorizeEntry`, and
`WithDelegates` refuse a tree nested past 64 levels for the same reason. The
values and their rationale live on the constants in `decode.go`. This does not
change any emitted bytes: the limits only bound what the library is willing to
read.

## The delegate model

Under CAP-71-01 an account may authenticate through delegated signers instead of
signing itself. The tree can nest arbitrarily:

![The delegate tree: an account at the top level, with delegates A and B, and a nested delegate A1 under A. Every node signs one payload, bound to the top-level address.](docs/diagrams/delegate-tree.svg)

The source is
[`docs/diagrams/delegate-tree.dot`](docs/diagrams/delegate-tree.dot); regenerate
the SVG with `make diagrams`.

<details>
<summary>Text fallback of the same tree, for terminal readers</summary>

```text
account  (top-level, signature may be ScvVoid)
├── delegate A
│   └── delegate A1        ← nested, same payload
└── delegate B
```

</details>

**Every node signs the same payload**, bound to the _top-level_ address. Three
consequences the code enforces:

- One address appearing at two depths is filled by a **single** `AuthorizeEntry`
  call, and both nodes receive byte-identical signatures.
- Once any node is signed the expiration is fixed; signing another node at a
  different `validUntilLedger` is refused.
- Each delegates array is sorted by the **XDR encoding** of the address and
  checked for duplicates within that level. Across levels, repeats are legal.

An unsigned node only fails if the account's `__check_auth` calls
`delegate_account_auth` for it — the host then passes that node's signature to
the delegate (CAP-71-01, _Semantics → `delegate_account_auth`_). The recommended
contract pattern delegates to every listed signer, so treat unsigned nodes as
failing unless you know the account's policy.

## Correctness model

soroauth is evidence-driven. Two independent gates:

**Golden vectors** — `testdata/vectors/*.json`, generated by
`testdata/gen/gen.mjs` against a pinned `@stellar/stellar-sdk@17.1.0`. For each
case `golden_test.go` asserts the preimage bytes, the payload hash, and the
final signed entry are byte-identical to the reference. Delegate vectors also
reproduce `WithDelegates` from the recorded _unsorted_ input, so ordering is
proven rather than re-read. CI regenerates and fails on drift.

**Passkey shape vectors** — `testdata/vectors/passkey/*.json`, generated by
`testdata/gen/gen-passkey.mjs` against a pinned `smart-account-kit@0.8.0`. For
each case `passkey_golden_test.go` asserts `Secp256r1SignatureScVal` reproduces
the reference library's `{public_key, signature}` map byte for byte, including
the leading-zero and high-bit edge encodings, and that the library's complete
return value is that map wrapped in a one-element vector. This is the one shape
in the library with no CAP behind it: a custom account's `__check_auth` defines
its signature ScVal, so the evidence is a real wallet library's output. The two
generators share one directory and one drift check.

**Live testnet** — `e2e/` (build tag `e2e`) submits real transactions covering
all three arms, classic multisig, three contract fixtures (`modular-account`,
`session-keys`, `threshold-account`), and deliberate rejections that assert the
_specific_ error: the host's for a refused signature, and the contract's own
code for an expired session key or an M-1 threshold. Results in
[e2e/RESULTS.md](e2e/RESULTS.md).

The rejection scenarios matter as much as the acceptances: they are what stop
the accepting scenarios from passing by accident. Two of them originally passed
while proving nothing, which is why every new failure test must assert _which_
failure.

The passkey path — browser ceremony, assertion verification, the
challenge-binding check, and which wallet contract a signature ScVal targets —
has its own guide: [docs/passkeys.md](docs/passkeys.md). Teams replacing
hand-rolled signing code have [docs/migrating.md](docs/migrating.md): pattern
mappings, the four JS-SDK differences, and the byte-identical verification step.

## Non-goals

soroauth is not a transaction builder, an RPC client, a key manager, or a
human-readable "what am I signing" explainer. It consumes go-stellar-sdk's
`txnbuild` and `clients/rpcclient` rather than wrapping them, and `Inspect`
reports structure only. `adapters/walletsdk` is the one place a wallet SDK is
named, and it is a module of its own so that importing soroauth never drags one
along.

## Extending it

- **New signer**: implement `Signer`. The `ScVal` you return is written
  verbatim.
- **Anything touching the wire format**: cite the CAP and ship a golden vector.
- **New rejection test**: assert the specific host error, not just failure.
